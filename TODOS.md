# Todos
* Rename functions, variables and files
* Create header files, because I deleted them

* Rename functions from convention (_create, _free, object_verb)
* Implement status codes (Unix convention) instead of binary return value
* Implement multithreading in search function
* Impelment SIGUSR2 between threads?
* Implement one thread for handling stdin and one thread for handling stdout (thinking)
* Implement SIGUSR1 between threads
